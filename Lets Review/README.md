<h1>Lets-Review</h1>

<h2>Task</h2>
Given a string, S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1, print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as 2 space-separated strings on a single line 
(see the Sample below for more detail).<br>

Note: 0 is considered to be an even index.<br>

<h2>Input Format</h2>
The first line contains an integer, T (the number of test cases). Each line i of the T subsequent lines contain a String, S.

<h2>Constraints</h2>
1 <= T <= 10 and 2 <= length of S <= 10000

<h2>Output Format</h2>
For each String Sj (where 0<=j<T-1), print Sj's even-indexed characters, followed by a space, followed by Sj's odd-indexed characters.
